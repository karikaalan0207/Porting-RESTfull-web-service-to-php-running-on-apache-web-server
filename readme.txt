I have implemented 3 functionalities, namely add student, remove student and disp info of a rollno using phpmyadmin

we need to create a database named assignment and create a table called students and have 3 columns : rollno,name,year

we also need to change the username and password of the myphpadmin db


---------------------------------
add data is done using addstd.php and its corresponding rewrite is in .htaccess as addstud/rollno/name/year

-------------------------------

remove data is done using delstd.php and its corresponding rewrite is in .htaccess as delstud/rollno
--------------------------------
disp data is done using retdata.php and its corresponding rewrite is in .htaccess as showdat/rollno
